# Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Digital Twin Simulation module! This comprehensive course covers the essential concepts of digital twins in robotics, physics-based simulation using Gazebo, and high-fidelity visualization with Unity for humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This module introduces you to the concept of digital twins as the simulation layer for humanoid robotics. You'll learn how to create physics-based simulations using Gazebo and high-fidelity visualization and interaction using Unity. The focus is on sensor simulation for perception-driven robotics, which is crucial for developing robust AI systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Digital Twins for Physical AI**: Understanding the concept of digital twins in robotics, the role of simulation in humanoid robot development, and simulation-first workflows before real-world deployment
- **Physics Simulation with Gazebo**: Simulating gravity, friction, and collisions; environment creation and world files; running humanoid robots inside Gazebo; validating robot behavior under physical constraints
- **High-Fidelity Interaction & Sensors**: Human-robot interaction and visualization in Unity; simulating robotic sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs); using sensor data streams for perception and control pipelines

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services)
- Basic knowledge of robot modeling (URDF format)

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter to understand the foundational concepts of digital twins, then progress through each chapter sequentially to build on previous knowledge. Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning and use the examples provided throughout the module.
