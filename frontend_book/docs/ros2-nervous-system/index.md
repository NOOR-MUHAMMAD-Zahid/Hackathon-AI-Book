# ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System course module. This module covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system of humanoid robots, communication primitives for robot control, and structural modeling using URDF.

## Course Overview

In this module, you will learn:

- How ROS 2 functions as the nervous system of humanoid robots
- Communication patterns using nodes, topics, and services
- How to model humanoid robots using URDF files
- Best practices for connecting Python-based AI agents to physical robot controllers

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of AI concepts
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Course Structure

This module is divided into three main chapters:

1. [Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System](./introduction-to-ros2.md) - Foundational knowledge of ROS 2 architecture
2. [ROS 2 Communication: Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2-communication.md) - Practical implementation of communication patterns
3. [Modeling Humanoids with URDF](./urdf-modeling.md) - Structural modeling of robots using URDF

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture including nodes, executors, and DDS communication
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes with proper communication patterns
- Model humanoid robots using URDF files with proper links and joints
- Connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 controllers using rclpy
