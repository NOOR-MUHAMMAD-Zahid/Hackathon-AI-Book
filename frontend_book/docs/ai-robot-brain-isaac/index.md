# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the AI-Robot Brain module! This comprehensive course covers advanced perception and navigation for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technologies. You'll learn about Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception pipelines, and autonomous navigation using Nav2.

## Overview

This module introduces advanced concepts in robotics perception and navigation using NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem. You'll learn how to create intelligent humanoid robot brains that can process sensor data efficiently and navigate autonomously. The focus is on using Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for accelerated perception, and Nav2 for humanoid navigation.

## What You'll Learn

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data**: Photorealistic simulation, synthetic dataset generation, domain randomization, and bridging to ROS 2 pipelines
- **Isaac ROS: Accelerated Perception**: Isaac ROS architecture, hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM, real-time perception pipelines, and sensor integration
- **Autonomous Navigation with Nav2**: Navigation stack for humanoid robots, localization/mapping/path planning, adapting Nav2 for bipedal movement, and perception-planning-control coordination

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services)
- Basic knowledge of robot modeling (URDF format)
- Understanding of simulation concepts (covered in Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation)

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand Isaac Sim and synthetic data generation, then progress through each chapter sequentially to build on previous knowledge. Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning and use the examples provided throughout the module.
