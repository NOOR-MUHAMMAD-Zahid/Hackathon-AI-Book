# Digital Twin Concept Diagram

[Diagram showing the relationship between physical robot and digital twin]

## Description
This diagram illustrates the concept of a digital twin in robotics, showing how a virtual representation mirrors the physical robot and enables simulation, testing, and validation before real-world deployment.

## Key Elements
- Physical Robot
- Digital Twin (Virtual Representation)
- Simulation Environment
- Data Flow between Physical and Virtual
- Validation Process
