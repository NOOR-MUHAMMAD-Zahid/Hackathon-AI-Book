# Perception-Grounded Planning Diagram

[Diagram showing environmental perception integrated into cognitive planning loops]

## Description
This diagram shows the process of perception-grounded planning where environmental perception data is integrated into the cognitive planning loop. It illustrates how LLM-generated plans are refined and validated using real-world perception data to ensure grounded and executable robot behaviors.
