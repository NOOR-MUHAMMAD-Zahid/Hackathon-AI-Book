# Autonomous Humanoid Architecture Diagram

[Diagram showing the system architecture for end-to-end autonomous humanoid with all subsystems]

## Description
This diagram illustrates the complete system architecture for an end-to-end autonomous humanoid robot. It shows the integration of voice command processing, cognitive planning, perception, navigation, manipulation, and coordination systems working together to achieve complex tasks from natural language commands.

## Key Elements
- Voice Command Processing Subsystem
- Intent Understanding Component
- Cognitive Planning (LLM-based)
- Perception System (cameras, sensors)
- Navigation System
- Manipulation System
- Coordination Manager
- Execution System
- Simulation Environment Interface
- ROS 2 Communication Layer
- Feedback and Monitoring Systems
