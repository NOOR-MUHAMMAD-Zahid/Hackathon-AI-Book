# LLM Planning Architecture Diagram

[Diagram showing LLM integration for robotic task decomposition and planning]

## Description
This diagram illustrates the architecture for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with robotic systems for cognitive planning. It shows how natural language goals are processed by an LLM to generate structured action sequences that are then executed by the ROS 2 action system.

## Key Elements
- Natural Language Goal Input
- LLM Task Decomposer
- Structured Action Sequence
- ROS 2 Action Planner
- Robot Execution System
- Safety and Constraint Checker
- Perception Integration
- Environmental Context
