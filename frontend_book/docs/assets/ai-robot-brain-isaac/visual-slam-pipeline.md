# Visual SLAM Pipeline Diagram

[Diagram showing the Isaac ROS Visual SLAM processing pipeline]

## Description
This diagram illustrates the Visual SLAM processing pipeline in Isaac ROS, showing how camera images are processed through GPU-accelerated stages to produce real-time localization and mapping. The pipeline includes feature detection, pose estimation, map building, and optimization stages.

## Key Elements
- Input: Camera images and IMU data
- Feature Detection and Matching
- Pose Estimation
- Map Building
- Loop Closure Detection
- Bundle Adjustment
- Output: Camera poses and 3D landmarks
