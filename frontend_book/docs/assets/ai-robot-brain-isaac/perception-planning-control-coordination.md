# Perception-Planning-Control Coordination Diagram

[Diagram showing the coordination between perception, planning, and control systems in Nav2]

## Description
This diagram illustrates the tight coordination required between perception, planning, and control systems in the Nav2 stack for humanoid robots. It shows the flow of information and feedback loops between these subsystems, highlighting how perception feeds into planning, planning guides control, and control provides feedback for the entire system.

## Key Elements
- Perception System (sensors, obstacle detection, environment understanding)
- Planning System (global/local planners, path optimization)
- Control System (trajectory following, low-level actuation)
- Feedback Loops (status, errors, adjustments)
- Coordination Interfaces (data exchange points)
- Safety Systems (emergency stops, balance monitoring)
