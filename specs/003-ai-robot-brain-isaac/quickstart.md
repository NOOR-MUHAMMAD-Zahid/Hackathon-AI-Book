# Quickstart: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
This module introduces advanced perception and navigation for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac technologies. You'll learn about Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception pipelines, and autonomous navigation using Nav2. The focus is on creating intelligent humanoid robot brains that can process sensor data efficiently and navigate autonomously.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of robotics concepts (covered in Module 1: ROS 2 Robotic Nervous System)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services)
- Basic knowledge of robot modeling (URDF format)
- Understanding of simulation concepts (covered in Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation)

## Learning Path
The module is organized into three progressive chapters:

### Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data
- Role of photorealistic simulation in Physical AI
- Generating synthetic datasets for perception models
- Domain randomization for robust robot learning
- Bridging Isaac Sim outputs to ROS 2 pipelines
- Hands-on exercise: Creating a synthetic dataset for perception training

### Chapter 2: Isaac ROS: Accelerated Perception
- Overview of Isaac ROS architecture
- Hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM (VSLAM)
- Real-time perception pipelines for humanoid robots
- Integrating cameras and sensors with ROS 2
- Hands-on exercise: Implementing Isaac ROS perception pipeline

### Chapter 3: Autonomous Navigation with Nav2
- Navigation stack overview for humanoid robots
- Localization, mapping, and path planning concepts
- Adapting Nav2 for bipedal humanoid movement
- Coordinating perception, planning, and control
- Hands-on exercise: Configuring Nav2 for humanoid navigation

## Getting Started
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to understand Isaac Sim and synthetic data generation
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially to build on previous knowledge
