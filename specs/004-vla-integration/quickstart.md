# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
This module introduces Vision-Language-Action integration for humanoid robotics, covering voice-to-action interfaces, cognitive planning with vision-language models, and autonomous humanoid systems. You'll learn how to connect human language commands to robot actions through perception and planning systems, enabling natural human-robot interaction.

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of robotics concepts (covered in previous modules)
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services)
- Basic knowledge of LLMs and their integration with robotic systems
- Understanding of perception and navigation concepts (covered in previous modules)

## Learning Path
The module is organized into three progressive chapters:

### Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces
- Voice interaction as a control modality for robots
- Speech-to-text pipelines using OpenAI Whisper
- Converting voice commands into structured robot intents
- Integrating voice inputs into ROS 2 action flows
- Hands-on exercise: Implementing a basic voice command processor

### Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with Vision-Language Models
- Using LLMs for high-level task decomposition
- Translating natural language goals into ROS 2 action sequences
- Incorporating visual perception into planning loops
- Safety, grounding, and constraint-aware planning
- Hands-on exercise: Creating an LLM-based task planner

### Chapter 3: Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid
- System architecture for an end-to-end autonomous humanoid
- Voice command reception and intent understanding
- Navigation, object recognition, and manipulation workflow
- Coordinating perception, planning, and execution in simulation
- Hands-on exercise: Implementing a complete autonomous humanoid system

## Getting Started
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to understand voice-to-action interfaces
2. Progress through each chapter sequentially to build on previous knowledge
3. Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
4. Use the examples and configurations provided throughout the module

## Expected Outcomes
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of voice interaction in Physical AI systems
- Implement speech-to-text pipelines using OpenAI Whisper that achieve high accuracy
- Translate natural language commands into structured robot intents that execute successfully
- Create LLM-based task decomposition systems that break down complex goals into executable action sequences
- Design complete autonomous humanoid systems that coordinate perception, planning, and execution
- Demonstrate understanding of safety and constraint-aware planning for humanoid robots
