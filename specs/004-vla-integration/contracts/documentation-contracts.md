# API Contracts: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
This module is a documentation-only feature for educational content. There are no API contracts required as it consists entirely of Docusaurus documentation pages explaining Vision-Language-Action integration, voice-to-action interfaces, cognitive planning with vision-language models, and autonomous humanoid systems.

## Documentation Endpoints
The module will be accessible as static documentation pages within the existing Docusaurus site structure:

### Chapter Pages
- `/docs/vla-integration/index.md` - Module introduction and overview
- `/docs/vla-integration/voice-to-action-interfaces.md` - Voice interaction and Whisper integration content
- `/docs/vla-integration/cognitive-planning-vision-language.md` - LLM-based planning and vision-language content
- `/docs/vla-integration/autonomous-humanoid-capstone.md` - Complete autonomous humanoid system content

## Content Structure
Each documentation page will follow the Docusaurus MDX format with:
- Frontmatter metadata
- Educational content with examples
- Code/configuration snippets
- Hands-on exercises
- References to related content
