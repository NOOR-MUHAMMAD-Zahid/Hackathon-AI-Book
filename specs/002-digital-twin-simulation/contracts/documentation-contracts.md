# API Contracts: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
This module is a documentation-only feature for educational content. There are no API contracts required as it consists entirely of Docusaurus documentation pages explaining digital twin concepts, Gazebo physics simulation, and Unity visualization for humanoid robotics.

## Documentation Endpoints
The module will be accessible as static documentation pages within the existing Docusaurus site structure:

### Chapter Pages
- `/docs/digital-twin-simulation/index.md` - Module introduction and overview
- `/docs/digital-twin-simulation/digital-twins-for-physical-ai.md` - Digital twin concepts and simulation-first workflows
- `/docs/digital-twin-simulation/physics-simulation-with-gazebo.md` - Gazebo physics simulation content
- `/docs/digital-twin-simulation/high-fidelity-interaction-sensors.md` - Unity visualization and sensor simulation

## Content Structure
Each documentation page will follow the Docusaurus MDX format with:
- Frontmatter metadata
- Educational content with examples
- Code/configuration snippets
- Hands-on exercises
- References to related content
